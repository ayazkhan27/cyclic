Greetings, Cryptographers!

If you are reading this, you have successfully decrypted my custom encryption algorithm. Congratulations on your accomplishment!

To celebrate your achievement, here's a little puzzle:

    What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?

Send me your answer, and let's discuss your journey to cracking this encryption.

Best regards,
Ayaz Khan
